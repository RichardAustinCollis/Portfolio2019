      <br>This is a project to be proud of. I really wanted to finish his body and give him an animation that makes it
      look like he's trying to swing his arms around like he did in the cartoon. Scrappy Doo and Scooby Doo were always
      two of my favorite troups and as a kid I couldn't get enough of them. I figured I'd show them some of the love I
      had for them in this project</br>

      <br>Another feather in my cap if I do say so myself. For a starter webpage this didn't turn out too bad. It could
      have turned out a lot better. I had ideas for when you click on a link it would have taken you to the area you
      were suppose to be and then the picture would have come in from one side and the text would come in from the other
      side, making this cool clashing look. The idea was never finished though simply due to time constrants.</br>

      <h17 id="aboutMe2">About Me</h17>
      <br></br>
      <br>Born in Elwood, Indiana, I started my passion for tech after ripping apart my dad's broken computer, removing
      the parts that were apparently broken, and fixing it, all at the age of 8. At 12 I started my first dive into code
      on a game called 'Starcraft' which provided players with the ability to change code in order to make different
      levels. My brother introduced me to the idea, but the internet provided me with more information on how I could
      achieve my ideas. Of course, over the years, computers, electronics, programs, games, and other devices have
      improved and become more intricate, the task would be more difficult for 8 and 12-year-old Austin to accomplish
      today. I've always loved technology and would love to make some games or robotics and thats what drives me to
      complete this course. Life is messy and tends to take us in directions we didn't intend. Finally, I'm working
      towards a goal I can be proud of and become someone I've always wanted to be. Old jobs have given me skills, like
      I can drive like a 'bat-outta-hell' from my 'Jimmy John's' days, how to do basic medical procedors from my days
      learning from 'Eli Lilly', and from my job at 'Happy Dog' the correct way to train, handle, and care for dogs.
      Skills that could randomly be helpful in my life, but less helpful when it comes to coding. <br>
